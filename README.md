# Image Classification Model

This Python 3.11 program is designed for image classification using TensorFlow. It utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, containing 60,000 images across ten classes. The program leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Adam optimizer for efficient model training. Users can customize the number of training epochs. The program also provides a straightforward evaluation process to measure the model's test accuracy. Furthermore, it includes a tool for visualizing training and validation accuracy over epochs, aiding in monitoring the model's performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Docker**: You need Docker installed to containerize and run this application. You can download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Usage
### Running with Docker container 

To run this project using Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Itamar-Dalal/image-classification.git

2. **Build the Docker Image**: Navigate to the project directory and build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.

   ```shell
    cd image-classification
    docker build -t image-classification-app .

3. **Run the Docker Container**: Start a Docker container from the image, specifying the number of training epochs as an environment variable. <br/>
***example***:
   ```shell
   docker run -p 80:80 -v /path/to/your/local/project/directory:/app -e NUM_EPOCHS=2 image-classification-app
Replace /path/to/your/local/project/directory with the actual path to the project directory on your machine.
Adjust the NUM_EPOCHS environment variable to set the number of training epochs (2 to 20).

4. **Access the results**: Once the program is finished, you can access the results by navigating to your project directory and opening the `plot.png`.

### Running Directly with Python

If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run the project directly using Python. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Itamar-Dalal/image-classification.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the project directory.

    ```shell
    cd (project directory)
3. **Run the Model**: Run the image classification model directly using Python.

    ```shell
    python model.py
You can specify the number of training epochs interactively when prompted.

# Further Learning
If you want to know how the model works, here are the concepts I used for this project:
- **CIFAR-10 dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: CNN is a deep learning algorithm specifically designed for any task where object recognition is crucial such as image
classification, detection, and segmentation. Many real-life applications, such as self-driving cars, surveillance cameras, and more, use CNNs.

**But what is a convolution?** 3Blue1Brown published a video explaining how convolution works. You can watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown">here</a>.

Here is the implementation of CNN in my code:

      ```python
      model = keras.Sequential(
                [
                    keras.layers.Conv2D(
                        32,
                        (3, 3),
                        activation="relu",
                        padding="same",
                        input_shape=(self.IMAGE_HEIGHT, self.IMAGE_WIDTH, 3),
                    ),
                    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
                    keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation="relu", padding="same"),
                    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
                    keras.layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation="relu", padding="same"),
                    keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
                    keras.layers.Flatten(),
                    keras.layers.Dense(128, activation="relu"),
                    keras.layers.Dense(self.NUM_CLASSES),
